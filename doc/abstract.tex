The main aim of this work is to study in a detailed way how to make
formalizations with a proof-assistant software such as Lean.

Firstly, some results belonging to the subjects Cálculo Infinitesimal
and Álgebra Básica from the degree in Mathematics at the University of
Seville has been formalized.

Later, a selection of problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) has been formalized. All of which have been done before.

Finally, the work concluds with a formalization of a problem, taken from
the IMO too, that hasn't been formalized before.
